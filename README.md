```
git clone https://github.com/AndersonRayner/teensy_4.0_breakout.git --recursive
```

## Usage
- As the connectors are matching the Pixhawk standard, using the 0.1" headers means you can reverse plug! 
- Power for each of the output rails can be selected using the jumpers (between 3V3 and 5V)

## Contributions
As always, PRs are welcome!
